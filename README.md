"How To Get/View Hardware Details/Information In Linux"...... How to find all hardware device details in a linux system....???? Here is the solution: "hwlist.sh" script.

This script has been tested to run successfully on Linux variants such as RHEL 7/6/5, SLES 12/11, Mint16, Ubuntu 16/14, BOSS 6(Debian) etc. running on 64/32 bit architectures. It may work on other variants as well, however, not tested. These tests were run on virtual machines. This is a small, light weight script which makes use of native Linux utilities to get the required details and doesn't need much space."
