Using command "hwlist".................

This command (hwlist) has been tested to run successfully on Linux variants such as RHEL 8(beta)/7/6, SLES/SLED 12/11, Mint16, Ubuntu 14/16/18, BOSS 6(Debian) etc. running on 64/32 bit architectures. It may work on other variants as well, however, not tested. These tests were run on virtual machines.  This is a small, light weight command which makes use of native Linux utilities to get the required details and doesn't need.

All you need to do is install 'hwlist-2.2-0.noarch.rpm' package on your system and then run the 'hwlist' command.
